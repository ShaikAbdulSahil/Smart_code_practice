Consider using a hash map (object in JavaScript) to store the numbers you've seen so far and their indices.

As you iterate through the array:
1. Calculate the complement (target - current number)
2. Check if the complement exists in your hash map
3. If it does, you've found your pair!
4. If not, add the current number and its index to the hash map

This approach lets you find the answer in a single pass through the array with O(n) time complexity.`,

You need to determine if the number reads the same backward as forward. There are a few approaches:

1. Convert to string and check if it equals its reverse
2. Or, build the reverse of the number directly:
   - Extract digits from right to left
   - Build a new number from these digits

Remember to handle negative numbers (they can't be palindromes because of the minus sign).`,

Break the problem down into smaller steps:

4. Start with a brute force solution and optimize

`### Code Analysis

Your implementation of the Two Sum problem uses a hash map approach, which is excellent!

#### Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: You're making a single pass through the array with a constant-time lookup operation.

#### Space Complexity
- **O(n)**: In the worst case, you might need to store almost all elements in the hash map.

#### Strengths
1. Optimal time complexity - this is the best possible solution
2. Clean implementation with clear variable names
3. Early return when a solution is found

#### Potential Improvements
1. You could add input validation (check if nums is null or empty)
2. Consider adding comments for better readability
3. The approach is already optimal, no algorithmic improvements needed

Overall, this is a very efficient solution to the Two Sum problem!`,

`### Code Analysis

You've implemented the Two Sum problem using a nested loop approach.

#### Time Complexity
- **O(nÂ²)**: The nested loops iterate through the array twice, giving quadratic time complexity.

#### Space Complexity
- **O(1)**: You're only using a constant amount of extra space.

#### Potential Optimizations
1. Consider using a hash map (object in JavaScript) to achieve O(n) time complexity:
   - As you iterate through the array, check if the complement (target - nums[i]) exists in the hash map
   - If it does, you've found your answer
   - If not, add the current number and its index to the hash map

2. This approach trades a bit of space complexity for a significant improvement in time complexity.

Example of optimized approach:
\`\`\`javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
    const map = new Map();
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        const complement = target - nums[i];
        
        if (map.has(complement)) {
            return [map.get(complement), i];
        }
        
        map.set(nums[i], i);
    }
    
    return null;
}
\`\`\`

This optimized solution has O(n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity.`,
        });
      } else {
        resolve({
          content: 
`### Code Analysis

I've analyzed your code and here are my observations:

#### Time Complexity
The current implementation appears to have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the input. This is because you're iterating through the data once.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(n) as you're storing additional data structures proportional to the input size.

#### Strengths
1. Your solution has a good approach to the problem
2. Variable names are descriptive
3. The code structure is logical and easy to follow

#### Potential Improvements
1. Consider adding more comments to explain the algorithm's logic
2. Add input validation to handle edge cases
3. Some parts could be extracted into helper functions for better readability
4. Consider handling potential errors more explicitly

Overall, your solution is on the right track! With a few refinements, it could be even better.`,
